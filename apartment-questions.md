Reddit's Rules of Apartment Rental (Organized)

- Neighborhood
    - Ask the neighbors what the worst part of the building, street, and neighborhood is.
    - Check parking availability.
    - Drive through the area during rush hour if commuting via car.
    - Drive through the area at 10pm one day, 2am the next, and see what kind of activity is occurring, especially on Fri/Sat nights.
    - When driving around, take note of what kinds of cars are parked around, and if they're substantially different from yours, your potential new neighbors lifestyle may differ from your own.
    - Walk through the complex around 8pm.
    - What's in close walking distance? (food, bars, stores, etc)
    - Check out the local grocery stores to get a good sense of the type of people that live in that neighborhood
    - Look up crime statistics for the area and ask the police how often they have been called to the street/complex in the last 6 months.
    - Check your car insurance rates at the various addresses. Good indicator of crime rates and can vary quite a bit over a short distance.
    - Check the closest gas station late at night.
    - Call a pizza place and see if they deliver there after dark.
        - If not, the place may have a history as being unsafe.
- Condition of Apartment
    - Request to see the exact unit you will be moving into, NOT a showcase apartment.
        - If they refuse to at least show you an actual unit, be suspicious.
    - If touring multiple units, take pictures of each for later comparison. When you decide on one, time-stamp photograph any damage and make sure landlord is notified of it in writing prior to move-in so you aren't blamed for it later.
    - An apartment with laundry facilities will save you money.
        - If they don't have them, check the prices/quality of the nearest ones.
    - If surrounding places have belongings left sitting on the porches (toys, stoves, seating, decorations), it's a good sign for little/no theft and a kid-friendly environment.
    - Try to get a look at as many different options in the area as possible so you can see if what they're offering is competitively priced for the size/type of unit you're seeking.
- The Landlord
    - What's the average rental time for apartments in the building?
        - If people aren't staying long, it's a bad sign.
    - Make sure the building managers or owners are local.
        - It's usually best to avoid living in the same building as your landlord, unless the other tenants vouch for them.
    - Who does the maintenance work?
        - Some handyman, a legit company, the landlord?
        - What are their policies on work orders?
        - Can they be submitted online?
        - What is their response time guarantee for after hours emergencies?
        - If it's just a single landlord and not a property management company, do they have someone you can call when they go on vacation and the hot water heater breaks?
    - Where are packages kept?
    - Check your responsibilities as a tenant.
        - After moving in many landlords require you to pay the cost of a stopped up toilet, pest infestations, and require you to shovel snow from sidewalk/mow the grass on areas around the house, or clean gutters.
        - They may also require you to pay the cost to fix supplied appliances.

    - If you must break the lease, what are the consequences/options?

    - Find out the policy on smoking, pets, noise, and visitors.
    - Check to see if you have a designated parking spot (and assure its cost, if any, is satisfactory).
        - Is the number of visitors you can have at a time enough for you?
        - On a Fri/Sat night, or any other evening/night, are there even any available spots?
        - What happens if someone takes your spot?
    - An experienced landlord is usually better to deal with than an inexperienced one.
    - If there's a homeowner's association, find out its rules.
    - Google your potential new landlord. Look up online property records in the county you are in.
        - Slumlords will generally have lots of liens against them and/or have multiple properties in foreclosure.
- Condition of Apartment Unit
    - 1st floor apartments are most convenient for thieves, and the most frequently broken into.

    - Check for cell reception.
    - Make sure there's an Internet provider suitable to your preferences.
    - Check the Bed Bug Registry online and ask if the building has a history of any pest problems.
    - Inspect tops of cabinets, behind stove/fridge, for poop.
        - If there are red/brown stains in the corners where the ceiling meets the walls, it's bed bugs.
        - If there is a line of white powder along the baseboards, it can mean roaches, but more likely bedbug treatment has been performed.
        - White powder behind fridge, stove, etc. is usually boric acid or diatomaceous earth used to treat roaches.
        - Brown or tan kernel sized paste is also used against roaches.
    - Inspect drawer under the oven and kitchen drawers.
    - Be wary of any musty smells that could indicate water damage. Too many air fresheners may be an attempt to hide this.
    - Check the water pressure on cold, on hot, on both, and how long it takes to get warm.
    - Fill all sinks/tubs. Drain simultaneously and flush each toilet during.
    - Bring a socket tester and test all outlets.
    - Make sure there are enough outlets in each room, and enough 3-prong ones.
    - Get an idea of the general price range of utilities such as heat and AC for the unit. Ask neighbors in similar units the general price range for heating/cooling.
    - Assure the windows are double-paned/double-glazed and in good repair if the area is cold to avoid high heating bills.
    - See if the windows open and close easily.
    - Assure the unit has adequate storage space for your needs.

- Legal
    - Research state tenant's rights laws.
    - Make sure you're completely clear on all terms of the lease and know what utilities you'll be paying and what payment method you'll need to use.
    - Ask if they accept Section 8 or convicted felons, if you care about those things.
    - If the leasing agent or landlord promises to do something before you move in, it needs to be written into the lease or it may not happen.
- www.apartmentratings.com may be a useful resource.
- Dress well, and ask for a discount.
