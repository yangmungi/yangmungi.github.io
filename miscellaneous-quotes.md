> If your enemy is secure at all points, be prepared for him. 
> If he is in superior strength, evade him. 
> If your opponent is temperamental, seek to irritate him. 
> Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant. 
> If he is taking his ease, give him no rest. 
> If his forces are united, separate them. 
> If sovereign and subject are in accord, put division between them. 
> Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected.

Sun Tzu

> By surrendering power to make trade policy decisions, congresspeople are more freely able to spout protectionist rhetoric, secure in the knowledge that they will be unable to take action.

IM Destler

> As with any creative endeavor, the line between acceptable influence and unethical appropriation is often subjective.
